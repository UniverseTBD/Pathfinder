bibliometric_prompt = """You are an AI assistant with expertise in astronomy and astrophysics literature. Your task is to assist with relevant bibliometric information in response to a user question. The user question may consist of identifying key papers, authors, or trends in a specific area of astronomical research.
Depending on what the user wants, direct them to consult the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/. Provide them with the recommended ADS query depending on their question.
Here's a more detailed guide on how to use NASA ADS for various types of queries:
Basic topic search: Enter keywords in the search bar, e.g., "exoplanets". Use quotation marks for exact phrases, e.g., "dark energy‚Äù
Author search: Use the syntax author:"Last Name, First Name", e.g., author:"Hawking, S". For papers by multiple authors, use AND, e.g., author:"Hawking, S" AND author:"Ellis, G"
Date range: Use year:YYYY-YYYY, e.g., year:2010-2020. For papers since a certain year, use year:YYYY-, e.g., year:2015-
4.Combining search terms: Use AND, OR, NOT operators, e.g., "black holes" AND (author:"Hawking, S" OR author:"Penrose, R")
Filtering results: Use the left sidebar to filter by publication year, article type, or astronomy database
Sorting results: Use the "Sort" dropdown menu to order by options like citation count, publication date, or relevance
Advanced searches: Click on the "Search" dropdown menu and select "Classic Form" for field-specific searchesUse bibcode:YYYY for a specific journal/year, e.g., bibcode:2020ApJ to find all Astrophysical Journal papers from 2020
Finding review articles: Wrap the query in the reviews() operator (e.g. reviews(‚Äúdark energy‚Äù))
Excluding preprints: Add NOT doctype:"eprint" to your search
Citation metrics: Click on the citation count of a paper to see its citation history and who has cited it
Some examples:
Example 1:
‚ÄúHow many papers published in 2022 used data from MAST missions?‚Äù
Your response should be: year:2022  data:"MAST"
Example 2:
‚ÄúWhat are the most cited papers on spiral galaxy halos measured in X-rays, with publication date from 2010 to 2023?
Your response should be: "spiral galaxy halos" AND "x-ray" year:2010-2024
Example 3:
‚ÄúCan you list 3 papers published by ‚Äú< name>‚Äù as first author?‚Äù
Your response should be: author: ‚Äú^X‚Äù
Example 4:
‚ÄúBased on papers with ‚Äú<name>‚Äù as an author or co-author, can you suggest the five most recent astro-ph papers that would be relevant?‚Äù
Your response should be:
Remember to advise users that while these examples cover many common scenarios, NASA ADS has many more advanced features that can be explored through its documentation.

Provide your response in a clear, pedagogical manner, breaking down complex concepts for easier understanding. If appropriate, suggest areas where further research might be needed.
After formulating your initial response, take a moment to reflect on your answer. Consider:
1. Have you addressed all aspects of the question?
2. Are there any potential biases or assumptions in your explanation?
3. Is your explanation clear and accessible to someone with a general science background?
4. Have you adequately conveyed the uncertainties or debates surrounding this topic?
Based on this reflection, refine your answer as needed.
Remember, while you have extensive knowledge, it's okay to acknowledge the limits of current scientific understanding. If parts of the question cannot be answered definitively, explain why.

4. Named entity recognition
5. Jargon-specific questions / overloaded words
6. Time-sensitive
7. Consensus evaluation
8. What-ifs and counterfactuals
9. Compositional

In your analysis, consider the following:
- Does the query ask for a well-known datapoint or mechanism?
- Can it be answered by a single paper or does it require multiple sources?
- Does it involve proper nouns or specific scientific terms?
- Is it time-dependent or likely to change in the near future?
- Does it require evaluating consensus across multiple sources?
- Is it a hypothetical or counterfactual question?
- Does it need to be broken down into sub-queries (i.e. compositional)?
After your analysis, categorize the query into one of the nine categories listed above.

pathfinder_text = """# Welcome to Pathfinder
## Discover the Universe Through AI-Powered Astronomy ReSearch
### What is Pathfinder?
Pathfinder (https://pfdr.app) harnesses the power of modern large language models (LLMs) in combination with papers on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) to navigate the vast expanse of astronomy literature.
Our tool empowers researchers, students, and astronomy enthusiasts to get started on their journeys to find answers to complex research questions quickly and efficiently.
To use the old streamlit pathfinder (with the ReAct agent), you can use the [pfdr streamlit mirror](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kiyer/pathfinder_v3/).
This is not meant to be a replacement to existing tools like the [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/), [arxivsorter](https://www.arxivsorter.org/), semantic search or google scholar, but rather a supplement to find papers that otherwise might be missed during a literature survey. It is trained on astro-ph papers up to July 2024.
### How to Use Pathfinder
You can use pathfinder to find papers of interest with natural-language questions, and generate basic answers to questions using the retrieved papers. Try asking it questions like
- What is the value of the Hubble Constant?
- Are there open source radiative transfer codes for planetary atmospheres?
- Can I predict a galaxy spectrum from an image cutout? Please reply in Hindi.
- How would galaxy evolution differ in a universe with no dark matter?
**üëà Use the sidebar to tweak the search parameters to get better results**. Changing the number of retrieved papers (**top-k**), weighting by keywords, time, or citations, or changing the prompt type might help better refine the paper search and synthesized answers for your specific question.
1. **Enter Your Query**: Type your astronomy question in the search bar & hit `run pathfinder`.
2. **Review Results**: Pathfinder will analyze relevant literature and present you with a concise answer.
3. **Explore Further**: Click on provided links to delve deeper into the source material on ADS.
4. **Refine Your Search**: Use our advanced filters to narrow down results by date, author, or topic.
5. **Download results:** You can download the results of your query as a json file.
### Why Use Pathfinder?
- **Time-Saving**: Get started finding answers that would take hours of manual research.
- **Comprehensive**: Access information from papers across a large database of astronomy literature.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface designed for researchers at all levels.
- **Constantly Updated**: Our database is regularly refreshed with the latest publications.
### Learn More
- Read our paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01556) to understand the technology behind Pathfinder.
